abstract={Side-channel attacks are an increasingly important concern for the security of cryptographic embedded devices, such as the SIM cards used in mobile phones. Previous works have exhibited such attacks against implementations of the 2G GSM algorithms (COMP-128, A5). In this paper, we show that they remain an important issue for USIM cards implementing the AES-based MILENAGE algorithm used in 3G/4G communications. In particular, we analyze instances of cards from a variety of operators and manufacturers, and describe successful Differential Power Analysis attacks that recover encryption keys and other secrets (needed to clone the USIM cards) within a few minutes. Further, we discuss the impact of the operator-defined secret parameters in MILENAGE on the difficulty to perform Differential Power Analysis, and show that they do not improve implementation security. Our results back up the observation that physical security issues raise long-term challenges that should be solved early in the development of cryptographic implementations, with adequateÂ countermeasures.},

abstract={One of the goals of smart environments is to improve the quality of human life in terms of comfort and efficiency. The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has recently evolved into a technology for building smart environments. Security and privacy are considered key issues in any real-world smart environment based on the IoT model. The security vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems create security threats that affect smart environment applications. Thus, there is a crucial need for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) designed for IoT environments to mitigate IoT-related security attacks that exploit some of these security vulnerabilities. Due to the limited computing and storage capabilities of IoT devices and the specific protocols used, conventional IDSs may not be an option for IoT environments. This article presents a comprehensive survey of the latest IDSs designed for the IoT model, with a focus on the corresponding methods, features, and mechanisms. This article also provides deep insight into the IoT architecture, emerging security vulnerabilities, and their relation to the layers of the IoT architecture. This work demonstrates that despite previous studies regarding the design and implementation of IDSs for the IoT paradigm, developing efficient, reliable and robust IDSs for IoT-based smart environments is still a crucial task. Key considerations for the development of such IDSs are introduced as a future outlook at the end of this survey.},
